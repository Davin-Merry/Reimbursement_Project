# Reimbursement Project
A financial reimbursement system made using Java.

Includes the following:
PostgreSQL script containing the tables, functions, triggers, and test data inserted to said tables.
A Maven project containing all the mid-end (Java) and front-end (HTML, Javascript, CSS) files.

**NOTE**:
The code in this project has very little documentation. Over time, I will try to add some documentation
